## Problem Statement
A few years ago, the United States District Court of Houston had a case that arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 200e et seq. The plaintiffs in this case were all female doctors at Houston College of Medicine who claimed that the College has engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against women in giving promotions and setting salaries. The Lead plaintiff in this action, a pediatrician and an assistant professor, was denied for promotion at the College. The plaintiffs had presented a set of data to show that female faculty at the school were less likely to be full professors, more likely to be assistant professors, and earn less money than men, on average.
